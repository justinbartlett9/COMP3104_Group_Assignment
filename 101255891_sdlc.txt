Devops:

DevOps is important because it's a software development and 
operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance 
of existing deployments

Teams who fully embrace DevOps practices work smarter and faster, and deliver better quality to their customers. 
The increased use of automation and cross-functional collaboration reduces complexity and errors, 
which in turn improves the Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) when incidents and outages occur.

Benefits of DevOps can bring consistent improvements in maintaining software quality, scale and predictability, 
reduce the cost of designing, testing, writing and deploying software, and satisfy customer requirements faster.

DevOps supports the Agile development methodology and shares many of its values such as continuous improvement, fast delivery,
smooth communication, etc. DevOps and Agile perfectly complement each other.

What problems does DevOps solve? It is aimed at streamlining, speeding up, adding predictability, scalability, flexibility, 
and website security to the processes of software development, testing, deployment, management, and maintenance.
