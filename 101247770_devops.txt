In our COMP 3104 DevOps course, we learn about the combination of software development and 
information technology to streamline the process of developing applications for clients. 
So far, we have learned about specific areas in the DevOps process that help developers 
remain autonomous and provoke better collaboration. We have learned about the CI/CD pipeline 
and how it bridges the gap between development and operation teams when building, testing and 
deploying code. Next, we learned about Version Control Systems like Git and how they help 
collaboration in teams and keep track of changes in code. Now, we are learning about CI tools 
and their interaction with version control to help ensure code can be built without and errors for 
future implementations.
