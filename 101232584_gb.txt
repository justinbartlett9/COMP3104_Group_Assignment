George Brown information, 

George Brown College of Applied Arts and Technology is a college located in several areas of downtown 
Toronto as well as smaller campuses scattered around the GTA. 
The most interesting aspect of the Spadina campus is that the building was built at two different points 
in time so in one building you'll be on floor 3 but when you walk too far you actually are on the second 
floor of a whole other building without ever changing elevation. Fascinating stuff for sure.
Also, one would think that the using the Tim Horton's inside the school would be faster but the one on Dupont is 
far superior.
