COMP3104 - Devops
In this course we are learning how to employ devops strategies to effectively create and maintain softare.
So far we have worked with Git and Travis.
Our midterm is coming up so I will be studying devops very hard.

In 1993 the Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture Consortium (TINA-C) defined a Model of a Service Lifecycle that combined software development with (telecom) service operations. Some say that DevOps emerged in part as a reaction to the "top-down" proscriptive approach of ITIL in the 1990s. DevOps, as a "bottom-up" approach, gained traction and persisted because it was created by software engineers for software engineers, and is a flexible practice rather than a rigid framework.
In 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.

DevOps practices, and their dependencies include a dependency network which connects potential benefits to an ordered chain of practices. Using this network organizations can choose a path that enables fulfillment of their goals.
