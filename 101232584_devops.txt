DevOps at GBC,

DevOps course at GBC, taking what we learned a year ago in Linux and applying new and old bash commands into an actually intuitive manner. 
Taking the first quarter of the course and really building a foundation of how to use terminals as well as GitHub is something that not everyone 
may know by now but is fundamentally crucial in the working world. Our program hasn't really had any form of class or reinforcement
about the importance of working together and this class is the first one to really put an emphasis on collaboration. DevOps also builds
a foundation of people learning transparency and communication skills amongst everyone involved in projects ranging from users to developers.
