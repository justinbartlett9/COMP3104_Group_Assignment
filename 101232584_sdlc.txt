Opinions on DevOps,

The minimum someone has to take out of this course is the ability to adopt all practices that allow team members 
to collaborate together in a software and physical medium. It is not enough to be able to commit to GitHub on your 
own projects but learning how to work together is extremely undervalued, as well as a new way to develop 
communication skills. While learning the ins and outs of GitHub, there is definitely a learning curve when it comes
to modifying repos with other people but learning these skills now will save you from doing catastrophic issues in the future.
You can easily delete your entire groups work as well as upload your own, the power is in your hands.
